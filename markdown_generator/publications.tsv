This new kernel significantly improves the translational (and rotational) grid-variance of the velocity-interpolation and force-spreading schemes of the IB method. (UPDATE: a new 5-point IB kernel is added to the arXiv version.)"	"Y. Bao, J. Kaye, C. S. Peskin.

The IB formulation uses an Eulerian representation of the fluid and a Lagrangian representation of the structure. The Lagrangian and Eulerian frames are coupled by integral transforms with delta function kernels. The discretized IB equations use approximations to these transforms with regularized delta function kernels to interpolate the fluid velocity to the structure, and to spread structural forces to the fluid. It is well-known that the conventional IB method can suffer from poor volume conservation since the interpolated Lagrangian velocity field is not generally divergence-free, and so this can cause spurious volume changes. In practice, the lack of volume conservation is especially pronounced for cases where there are large pressure differences across thin structural boundaries. The aim of this paper is to greatly reduce the volume error of the IB method by introducing velocity-interpolation and force-spreading schemes with the properties that the interpolated velocity field in which the structure moves is at least C1 and satisfies a continuous divergence-free condition, and that the force-spreading operator is the adjoint of the velocity-interpolation operator. We confirm through numerical experiments in two and three spatial dimensions that this new IB method is able to achieve substantial improvement in volume conservation compared to other existing IB methods, at the expense of a modest increase in the computational cost. Further, the new method provides smoother Lagrangian forces (tractions) than traditional IB methods. The method presented here is restricted to periodic computational domains. Its generalization to non-periodic domains is important future work."	"Y. Bao, A. Donev, B. E. Griffith, D. M. McQueen, C. S.

2017-09-06	A fluctuating boundary integral method for Brownian suspensions	Journal of Computational Physics	"We present a fluctuating boundary integral method (FBIM) for Brownian Dynamics of suspensions of rigid particles of complex shape immersed in a Stokes fluid. We develop a linear-scaling algorithm to generate, together, both the deterministic (mean) component of the particle linear and angular velocities that arise in response to the applied forces and torques, as well as the stochastic (fluctuating) Brownian displacements that arise in response to the thermal fluctuations in the fluid. In this work we restrict our attention to two-dimensional periodic domains, however, our key ideas can be extended to three dimensions and confined suspensions. Our approach relies on a first-kind boundary integral formulation of a Stochastic Stokes Boundary Value Problem (SSBVP) in which a random surface velocity is prescribed on the particle surface. This random surface velocity has zero mean and covariance proportional to the Green's function for the Stokes flow (Stokeslet). We demonstrate that the Brownian displacements generated by solving this SSBVP obey the fluctuation-dissipation balance relation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that discretizing the first-kind formulation using standard boundary integral techniques leads to an efficient numerical method that strictly preserves discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance (DFDB). Near-field contributions to the Brownian displacements are efficiently approximated by iterative methods in real space, while far-field contributions are rapidly generated by fast Fourier-space methods based on fluctuating hydrodynamics. FBIM provides the key ingredient for time integration of the overdamped Langevin equations for Brownian suspensions of rigid particles. We demonstrate that FBIM obeys DFDB by performing equilibrium BD simulations of suspensions of starfish-shaped bodies using a random finite difference temporal integrator."	"Y. Bao, M. Rachh, E.
