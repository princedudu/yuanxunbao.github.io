title: "A Gaussian-like immersed-boundary kernel with three continuous derivatives and improved translational invariance"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/IBkernel-JCP2016
excerpt: 'In this work we present a new 6-point Immersed-Boundary (IB) kernel, i.e., a regularized delta function with three continuous derivatives. This new kernel significantly improves the translational (and rotational) grid-variance of the velocity-interpolation and force-spreading schemes of the IB method. (UPDATE: a new 5-point IB kernel is added to the arXiv paper.)'
