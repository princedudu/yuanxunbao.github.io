In this work we present a new 6-point Immersed-Boundary (IB) kernel, i.e., a regularized delta function with three continuous derivatives. This new kernel significantly improves the translational (and rotational) grid-variance of the velocity-interpolation and force-spreading schemes of the IB method. (UPDATE: a new 5-point IB kernel is added to the arXiv paper.)
