excerpt: 'In the Immersed Boundary (IB) method for fluid-strucutre interacitons, the Eulerian representation of the fluid and the Lagrangian representation of the immersed structure are coupled via integral transforms of a regularized delta function, i.e., IB kernel. In this work we present IB kernels that have three continuous derivatives and feature substantially improved translational (and rotational) invariance compared to existing IB kernels.'

Abstract: The immersed boundary (IB) method is a general mathematical framework for studying problems involving fluidâ€“structure interactions in which an elastic structure is immersed in a viscous incompressible fluid. In the IB formulation, the fluid described by Eulerian variables is coupled with the immersed structure described by Lagrangian variables via the use of the Dirac delta function. From a numerical standpoint, the Lagrangian force spreading and the Eulerian velocity interpolation are carried out by a regularized, compactly supported discrete delta function, which is assumed to be a tensor product of a single-variable immersed-boundary kernel. IB kernels are derived from a set of postulates designed to achieve approximate grid translational invariance, interpolation accuracy and computational efficiency. In this note, we present new 5-point and 6-point immersed-boundary kernels that are C3 and yield substantially improved translational invariance compared to other common IB kernels.
